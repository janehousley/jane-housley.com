                Blogs are coming back in the same way that film cameras are coming back in. 
                Our brief rejection of both was a lust for modernity (the iPod Touch Camera and vlogging), 
                but now we're returning to our roots, recognizing the value in a grainy, 
                low-contrast photo and informally written words.

                Probably every history class you've taken has begun with the "why learn history?” lesson, 
                so you can consider this my “why write blog entries?” post. 
                When I go back and read my old journal entries, I'm often shocked by how little I remember, 
                even from my favorite days. It's a reminder to me of the importance of documentation: 
                photos, videos, written words. This blog acts as my expanded notes app, informal journal, 
                and a documentation of thoughts and experiences I've had.

            I thought I should probably give an introduction to myself. 
            Then I thought that trying to describe myself in a few sentences would be more effort 
            than it was worth. Here's as much as I will say: My name is Jane! Thanks for being here.
